# Django-easy-calculator
I made my first django app. It's very basic calculator. I hope i will help someone. I would like you to write me a review. I accept everything. Please contact me for any trouble. This is my first app so something may be made bad, but this was best solution for me.

Files:

There is ulrs.py redirecting you to functions. 

views.py include every function. 

calc.html and result.html is templates for this app. 

Function explain:

Using float instead of int because numbers like 1.3 or 10e4.

Using POST istead of GET because this thing on url part of browser ?cislo1=3R8ov2YBfTYmzF etc. It is better for security and clarity.

Using csrf token for best security.
