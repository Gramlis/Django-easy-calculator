# Django-easy-calculator
I made my first django app. It's very basic calculator. I hope i will help someone. I would like you to write me a review. I accept everything. Please contact me for any trouble. This is my first app so something may be made bad, but this was best solution for me.

There is ulrs.py redirecting you to functions. views.py include every function. calc.html and result.html is templates for this app. 

Im using float instead of int because numbers like 1.3 or 10e4. Also using POST istead of GET cause ?cislo1=3 etc. It is better for security and clarity.
